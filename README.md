📊 Student Marks Prediction using Machine Learning
📝 Project Overview
This project aims to predict student marks based on various input features such as study hours, previous performance, attendance, and other academic factors. The model leverages machine learning techniques to analyze patterns in student data and make accurate predictions.

🔍 Features
Data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature scaling, encoding categorical data)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and correlations

Implementation of multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)

Model evaluation using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R² score

Web-based interface for easy input and predictions (optional)
